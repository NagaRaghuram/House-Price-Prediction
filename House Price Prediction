Introduction:
         House Price Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, the number of bedrooms, location,and 
more.The project aims to provide accurate price estimates using data-driven models, which can be beneficial for real estate agents, buyers, and sellers.

Features:
>>Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
>>Model Training: Implementation of multiple regression models.
>>Evaluation: Performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R^2 Score.
>>Data Visualization: Graphical representations of data and model performance.
>>Prediction Interface: Simple interface to input house features and get a price prediction.

Modeling Approach:
The project employs various machine learning models to predict house prices, including:
>>Linear Regression: A baseline model that assumes a linear relationship between features and the target.
>>Random Forest: An ensemble model that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
>>Gradient Boosting: A powerful model that builds trees sequentially, focusing on correcting the errors of previous models.

Evaluation:
The performance of the models is evaluated using the following metrics:
>>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures the average magnitude of the error.
>>Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute error.
>>R^2 Score: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.

Configuration:
The project can be customized using configuration files or command-line arguments. Key configurable parameters include:
>>Training/Testing Split: Adjust the ratio of training to testing data.
>>Model Hyperparameters: Customize hyperparameters for each model (e.g., number of trees in Random Forest).
>>Feature Selection: Enable or disable certain features used in model training.
